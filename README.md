# Basic-API-Login
A Basic API Login with focus only in backend, you can register a user, logout and login into the app, I used: NodeJs, Html, Css, JavaScript, ExpressJs and some node modules.

The Node Modules are:

bcryptjs for crypt the password
ejs for the html
passport to check the password and login the user to the app, creating a session
mysql2 for the MySQL database

Too use this basic system, read the 'README' folder to see the instructions and use the npm init to install the modules.
Thank You!
